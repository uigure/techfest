To alleviate these issues, the government has crafted the Budget 2023, which aims to provide relief and support for families. A key part of this is the introduction of new workplace family supportive policies. From January 2024, paternity leave will be doubled from two weeks to four weeks, with employers having the option to grant additional two weeks of leave reimbursed by the government. Parental leave has also been increased from six days per year to twelve days per year for each parent during their child's first two years.\\n\\nTo further support families, the baby bonus cash gift has increased by S$3,000 per eligible child, and the CDA First Step Grant has been raised from S$3,000 to S$5,000. In addition, the CPF monthly salary ceiling has been increased in stages up to S$8,000 by 2026. The minimum CPF monthly payout for seniors has also been raised from S$250 to S$350 starting from June.\\n\\nTo help with immediate costs, eligible Singaporeans can expect a one-time cost-of-living special payment distributed in June 2023. First-time buyers of resale flats will benefit from an increased home grant of up to S$30,000. The government has also applied higher marginal buyer's stamp duty on properties purchased from February 15, targeting higher-value properties. This Budget 2023 package demonstrates Singapore's government's commitment to making life more affordable and supportive for families.\""
