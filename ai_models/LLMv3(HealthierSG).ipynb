We are shifting our emphasis from reactively caring for those who are sick, to proactively preventing individuals from falling ill. The key is for our population to reshape their health-seeking behaviours and lifestyles. To achieve this, we need to anchor Singapore residents with a family doctor, and foster community support for healthier lifestyles. Healthier SG will prevent or delay the deterioration of health, reduce the burden on loved ones, extend healthy life years and improve residents’ quality of life. It will also moderate the increase in healthcare expenditure over time. Since March 2022, we have consulted more than 6,000 residents, and extensively engaged stakeholders such as private General Practitioners (GPs), employers and community partners to design the key features of Healthier SG, as described in this White Paper.\n",
        "Residents:\n",
        "Individuals who visit a regular family doctor are generally healthier and have fewer visits to the emergency departments and hospitals. However, most doctor-patient relationships today are transactional and episodic, with residents visiting doctors to get medication for acute symptoms or medical certificates. Under Healthier SG, residents will be encouraged to choose and enrol with a family doctor. Residents will have some flexibility to change their family doctor to take into account changes in their life circumstances. The family doctor will serve as the first point-of-contact to holistically manage the residents’ health. To encourage residents to follow their health plan and to seek care with their enrolled family doctor, we will: • Fully subsidise nationally recommended screenings and vaccinations for Singapore Citizens; • Waive the requirement for residents to co-pay part of their bills in cash when using MediSave for chronic care management; • Introduce a new Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) drug subsidy tier for a whitelist of chronic disease management drugs so that their prices at private GP clinics are comparable with those at polyclinics; and • Leverage the health points system under the National Steps Challenge to offer rewards to residents for enrolling and completing their first consultation with their selected family doctor and for leading active and healthy lifestyles\n",
        "Community partner:\n",
        "Improving our health goes beyond a doctor’s visit. Family doctors will be able to make social prescriptions and encourage residents to adopt healthier lifestyles. Healthier SG will make it easier for residents to consciously connect to the wide range of activities provided by agencies such as Health Promotion Board, Agency for Integrated Care, People’s Association, Sport Singapore, and community partners. Additional support will be made available for seniors through our Eldercare Centres (ECs). By 2025, we can expect both the network and the service offerings of all ECs to be expanded and enhanced.\n",
